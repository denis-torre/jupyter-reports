<h1>Investigation of BI 2536 drug as a potential drug to attenuate diabetic nephropathy progression</h1>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>This notebook contains a preliminary computational analysis aimed at investigating the <b>biological effect of BI-2536 treatment</b> in cell lines.
BI-2536 was previously identified as a candidate small molecule which capability to <b>reverse gene expression signatures associated to diabetic nephropathy</b> (Lin et al., 2016).
For more information, please visit the diabetic nephropathy GEN3VA report page <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va/report/approved/diabetic_nephropathy">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In order to investigate the biological effect of BI-2536 treatment on cell lines, and its role in reversing diabetic nephropathy gene expression signatures, the following analysis was performed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, <b>24 diabetic nephropathy signatures</b> extracted from GEO were queried against the L1000 library of small molecule perturbations using <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/L1000CDS2/">L1000CDS<sup>2</sup></a>.
	This resulted in the identification of <b>3 BI-2536 treatment signatures</b>, which are collectively predicted to reverse the diabetic nephropathy signatures in <b>13 different matches</b>.</li>
	<li>Second, signatures corresponding to the 13 reverse matches processed in order to identify <b>two genesets</b> (see below for methods details):
		<ul>
			<li>A set of 310 genes <b>downregulated in diabetic nephropathy</b>, but <b>upregulated by BI-2536</b></li>
			<li>A set of 424 genes <b>upregulated in diabetic nephropathy</b>, but <b>downregulated by BI-2536</b></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Third, an enrichment analysis of these genesets was performed using <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/">Enrichr</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>Full enrichment results for the <b>genes upregulated by BI-2536</b> available <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1daev">here</a>.</li>
			<li>Full enrichment results for the <b>genes downregulated by BI-2536</b> available <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1dag2">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Geneset Identification</h3>
<p>In order to identify the two genesets used for the enrichment analysis, each of the 13 reverse matches was independently queried to identify two genesets: the set of genes which are upregulated by the drug treatment
and downregulated in the disease, and vice-versa. Subsequently, a count was performed in order to calculate how many times each gene appeared in each of these genesets.</p>

<p>Genes appearing in <b>over 5 matches</b> were selected for analysis.  Results below:</p>
